## 🧠 How It Works

This game uses your webcam in real time and detects:
- Your hand’s position
- Its distance from the camera
- When and where it interacts with the screen

Using OpenCV and a hand tracking module, we simulate a fun experience that blends **motion sensing**, **depth estimation**, and **game logic** — all powered by Python.
